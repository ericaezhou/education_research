# Economics Education Research
Previous research has established that transition from face-to-face instruction to distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts the academic performance of students in grade 3 through 8. To date, however, little is known if similar effects of instruction mode changes apply to students with higher grade levels. This study investigates this gap by using high school test proficiency and dropout rates data from six U.S. states. Contrary to the existing literature, this study reveals that, on average, test performance remained stable during the pandemic, with no substantial widening of achievement gap among marginalized groups. Additionally, the effect of instruction mode varied considerably across diverse education and social contexts, with some states demonstrating notable benefits from virtual and hybrid learning. Changes in dropout rates exhibit greater variability and less economic and statistical significance, suggesting intricate dropout dynamics influenced by various pandemic-related disruptions beyond mere instruction mode changes.
